            <h2>About NextStep – Your Smart College Admission Guide</h2>
            
            <p class="lead"><strong>Welcome to NextStep</strong> — your trusted partner for college admissions through <strong>JOSAA counselling</strong>, <strong>MHT-CET CAP rounds</strong>, and <strong>NEET-UG seat allotment</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>We specialize in providing <strong>personalized college preference lists</strong> based on your rank, helping you secure the best possible seat at your dream college.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p class="mb-0"><strong>No more guesswork. No more confusion. Only smart, strategic admission choices.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3 class="mt-4">Why Is Filling the Right College Preference List So Important?</h3>
            
            <p>The <strong>college choice filling</strong> process can make or break your future. Whether you are applying through JEE Main, JEE Advanced, MHT-CET, or NEET-UG, the order of your college preferences determines which college and course you finally get.</p>
            
            <p>Here's why filling your preference list correctly is crucial:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Avoid being over-ambitious</strong>: Listing only top colleges above your rank may leave you without any seat.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid being too safe</strong>: Choosing only lower-ranked options can waste your potential and career prospects.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic balance</strong> between ambitious, realistic, and safe options ensures the best outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>NextStep ensures that your college list is perfectly balanced to <strong>maximize your chances</strong> of getting into the best possible college based on your score.</p>
            
            <h3 class="mt-4">Common Mistakes Students Make During College Counselling</h3>
            
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>Not including backup colleges, resulting in no admission.</li>
                <li>Confusing college names and codes (especially in MHT-CET choice filling).</li>
                <li>Ignoring reservation policies and eligibility requirements.</li>
                <li>Choosing colleges without considering future goals like placements, research, or higher studies.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>At NextStep, we guide you to avoid these mistakes and make well-informed decisions.</p>
            
            <h3 class="mt-4">How NextStep Helps You</h3>
